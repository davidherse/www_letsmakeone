        <p>We channel thousands of small investments to tackle big problems. Problems like climate change and social injustice. We are bound by our values and code of ethics guiding positive environmental and social impact. We believe that if the business wins so should the ecosystem and people.</p>

          <li>Exercising proper diligence, care and attention;</li>
          <li>Using investor resources in an effective and accountable way;</li>

        <h6>Impact</h6>
        <p>We’re determined to lower our negative environmental impact and help you do this too. We are very conscious of how we run our business and the work we do each day.</p>

        <h6>Sustainability</h6>
        <p>Our goal is to create a sustainable business. One that doesn’t damage or put constant demands on the environment. That meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</p>
        <p>We score each project that we work for it’s negative and positive impact environmentally and socially. We welcome the challenge to find new and novel ways to provide profitable products and services while creating a net positive effect on the environment. By positive we mean creating products as sustainably as possible and they outperform existing solutions environmental impact. For example, if we can increase the uptake of renewable energy faster than is currently predicted, that’s a positive impact for us. It means we are pumping less carbon into the atmosphere and it gets the world closer to avoiding a climate crisis.</p>

Our goal is to not only avoid negatively impact or exploitation of people but to raise living and working conditions. This includes salaries above industry standard and above minimum wage and average working weeks of no longer than 38 hours. We expect our partners and suppliers to also meet this standard.</p>

        <h6>Continuous Improvement</h6>
        <p>We are always looking for ways we can do better. We are committed to reviewing our process, policies, products, services and people to find better ways of doing things. Ways to be more sustainable, reduce our negative impact environmentally and socially.</p>
