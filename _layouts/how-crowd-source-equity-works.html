        <h2>Crowd Source Equity (or Crowd Source Funding)</h2>

<p>Crowd-sourced funding (CSF) (also called 'equity crowd funding' or 'crowd-sourced funding of shares') is a way for start-ups and small and medium-sized companies to raise money from the public to finance their business. You can invest up to $10,000 a year in a company and in exchange you'll receive securities in the form of shares.</p>

<p>You can learn more about Crowd Source Funding on the <a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/crowd-sourced-funding/" target="_blank">Australia Securities & Investments Commission website (ASIC).</a></p>

<p>Crowd-sourced funding of shares is different from crowd funding
Crowd-sourced funding of shares is different from the donation-based crowd funding typically used by artists or entrepreneurs to raise money for one-off projects.</p>

<p>It is also different from investment-based crowd funding, which may involve investing in a managed investment scheme or be offered by someone who does not need an Australian financial services (AFS) licence..</p>

<p>If you want to invest in a company offering shares through a CSF website, you will be asked to acknowledge that you have read and understood the risk warning listed on the website and in the offer document.</p>

<p>You can only invest up to $10,000 per company in a 12-month period, so your application will be rejected if you try to invest more than the cap.</p>

<p>You have a cooling-off period of 5 business days to change your mind if you decide the investment isn't for you. During this time, you can withdraw your application to invest and receive a full refund.</p>
